## Version 1.2

v1.2 -
Added personalization options under settings, this is displayed at the bottom of the page during list view, next to the clear finished button.
Personalization options so far include changing header and focus color to anything the user wants, but the main view is not customizable to maintain readability. Also, the user can now select how they want their tasks ordered, either by priority first (priority -> soonest to latest) or just by soonest to latest and ignore priorities.

Some UI/UX changes to make elements feel more responsive and instant.
